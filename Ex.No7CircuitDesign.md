# Ex.No: 7  Logic Programming â€“  Logic Circuit Design
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: 
To write a logic program to design a circuit like half adder and half subtractor.
###  Algorithm:
1. Start the Program
2. Design a AND gate logic if both inputs are 1 then output is 1.
3. Design a OR gate logic if any one of input is 1 then output is 1.
4. Design a XOR gate logic if both inputs are different then output is 1.
5. Design a NOT gate logic if input is 0 then output is 1.
6. Design a half adder and half subtractor using the rules.
7. Test the logic.
8. Stop the program.

### Program:

```
move(1,X,Y,_) :-  
    write('Move top disk from '), 
    write(X), 
    write(' to '), 
    write(Y), 
    nl. 
move(N,X,Y,Z) :- 
    N>1, 
    M is N-1, 
    move(M,X,Z,Y), 
    move(1,X,Y,_), 
    move(M,Z,Y,X).

```

### Output:

### Result:
Thus the truth table of circuit verified sucessfully.
